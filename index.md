I am a postdoctoral associate in the Heintz lab at the Rockefeller University. I work with computational methods to analyze cellular diversity in human brain, with a focus on Huntington's Disease.

I completed my PhD from the Dept. of Biosciences and Bioengineering at the Indian Insitute of Technology Guwahati in 2019, where I studied silk biosynthesis, metamorphosis and allelochemical defense in the silkworm that produces the most expensive silk in the world, Antheraea assamensis.
