I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Heintz Lab](http://lab.rockefeller.edu/heintz/) at the Rockefeller University. I use computational methods to investigate the genomic differences across different cell types in human brain, with a focus on Huntington's Disease.

I completed my PhD from Bioengineering Research Lab (BERL) in the Dept. of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati in 2019, where I studied the silk biosynthesis, metamorphosis and allelochemical defense in the non-model Lepidopteran silkworm, *Antheraea assamensis*.
