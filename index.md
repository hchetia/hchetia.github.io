I am a postdoctoral associate in the <a href="http://lab.rockefeller.edu/heintz/">Heintz lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/">Rockefeller University</a> . I work with computational methods to analyze cellular diversity in human brain, with a focus on Huntington's Disease.

I completed my PhD from Bioengineering Research Lab (BERL) in the Dept. of Biosciences and Bioengineering, <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati</a> in 2019, where I studied silk biosynthesis, metamorphosis and allelochemical defense in the silkworm that produces the most expensive silk in the world, Antheraea assamensis.
